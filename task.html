                    <p>This project was coded by me to help me manage my time when it comes to task management. 
                    This project I have used to show a countdown to my due dates for college projects but to also give 
                    each project its own kanban helping me with focusing on what that project needs. I also added a page
                    which works as a Dev Log where I can add my progress from the game project and also add images. 
                    This project used the tools HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code and GitHub because of my work 
                    on this portfolio problems I faced while making it were less of a problem in this project. I used a 
                    mixture of my own personal knowledge and YouTube tutorials to make it in what I wanted it to be. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The whole purpose of this project was to have a website that I can use for project management 
                    which does have pop ups wanting me to spend money the entire time. 
                    </p>
