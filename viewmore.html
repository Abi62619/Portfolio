                    <p>My special focus when it comes to game design is Games Programming. 
                        I really enjoy problem-solving that comes with writing scripts and 
                        I am fascinated with seeing the end product that can be created. This 
                        is why I decided to create my own portfolio website. By doing this I 
                        got to learn new programming languages HTML, CSS and a little bit of 
                        JavaScript. However, my main focus is in C# as this is the programming 
                        language that I use within Unity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While I do love programming I have experience different areas of game 
                        design such as Level design, 3D modelling, Animation and creative writing. 
                        All parts of game developer interest me and this is why I want to go into 
                        the industry. The community that the industry creates is one of the main 
                        parts that drew into wanting to become a games programmer. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my time at college I participated in multiple interviews for the 
                        colleges social media marketing. This interviews involved explain my Game 
                        Jam project on camera and showcasing my work for video through a playthrough. 
                        This along with working in team projects help me expand on my communication skills. </p>
